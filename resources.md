# 🏫 CyberQuest Learning Resources

## 🎲 CyberQuest Board Game   
A family-friendly board game where students explore cybersecurity scenarios with parents/guardians, 
answer quiz questions, and learn best practices in a competitive and fun format.
 
## 🏫 In-Class Cyber Activities developed by Karishma
As part of our **CyberQuest** project, we’ve developed two engaging in-class activities 
to help schools raise cybersecurity awareness in fun and interactive ways:

> ### 🖍️ Digital Footprint Drawing Activity  
> A creative session where students draw their "digital selves" to reflect on the types 
> of personal data they share online. 
> This activity sparks important conversations about online safety and digital identity.

> ### 🔐 Escape Room: Cyber Challenge  
> A team-based escape room-style game where students solve puzzles and clues related to cyber safety, 
> phishing, passwords, and digital hygiene. Perfect for building collaboration and critical thinking!
