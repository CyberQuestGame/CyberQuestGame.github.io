CyberQuest Project !
==================

CyberQuest is a game for year 5 & 6 children.
>
> 74% of year 6 children have a social media platform*
>
> 28% of year 6 children feel their caregivers don't show interest in their internet use*


Our project, funded by the Cyber Local 2024–2025 initiative, aims to strengthen the cyber security sector in the East Midlands by developing innovative regional activities and events.

Led by **Loughborough university**, the project is supported by Innovate UK in collaboration with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).

CyberQuest Game
===============

The purpose of CyberQuest is to increase cyber awareness of children and parents 
through the means of a card game. The game is intended for year 5 and 6 pupils 
(usually ages 9-11) and aims to foster conversations around key cyber quests. 

Developed at **Loughborough University**, CyberQuest is designed to target the East Midlands 
region of the UK, although there is no reason it couldn’t be used more widely.
