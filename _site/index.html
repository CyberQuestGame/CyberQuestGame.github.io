<p>CyberQuest is a game for year 5 &amp; 6 children.</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>74% of year 6 children have a social media platform*</p>

  <p>28% of year 6 children feel their caregivers don’t show interest in their internet use*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our project, funded by the Cyber Local 2024–2025 initiative, aims to strengthen the 
cyber security sector in the East Midlands by developing innovative regional activities and events.</p>

<p>Led by <strong>Loughborough university</strong>, the project is supported by Innovate UK 
in collaboration with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).</p>

<h1 id="cyberquest-game">CyberQuest Game</h1>

<p>The purpose of CyberQuest is to increase cyber awareness of children and parents 
through the means of a card game. The game is intended for year 5 and 6 pupils 
(usually ages 9-11) and aims to foster conversations around key cyber quests.</p>

<p>Developed at <strong>Loughborough University</strong>, CyberQuest is designed to target the East Midlands 
region of the UK, although there is no reason it couldn’t be used more widely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*A large part of the project is based off findings from the 2024 LLC School Safeguarding Survey.</p>
