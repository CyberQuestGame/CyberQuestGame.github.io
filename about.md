	effort to promote female empowerment in technology, working with 'Girls in Tech' to 
	introduce coding to girls as young as 11 - well before it was formally offered in her 
	school's curriculum. She also co-organised Singapore’s first women and non-binary student 
	hacking competition, demonstrating her ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion 
	in the tech space. 
	Outside of her academics, Akshara enjoys netball, exploring new places, 
	and is a classically trained pianist and violinist.

	enthusiast who loves being on or in the water whenever he gets the chance.
* **Karishma Patel**: [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karishma-patel-a1385a208/)
	- Karishma Patel is a dedicated and hardworking individual with a strong passion for 
	enhancing cybersecurity education for children. 
	During her final year of university, she conducted comprehensive research 
	and a critical analysis of the current school curriculum. 
	This work led to the development of free cybersecurity education resources, 
	which are now widely available to schools to help bridge the gap in 
	digital safety awareness among young learners. 
	With a solid technical background, Karishma is committed to making a meaningful 
	impact through education. Outside of her academic work, she is a keen netball player, 
	an avid runner, and enjoys spending time with friends and family.
